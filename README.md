# ðŸŒ¸ Neon Blue Flower Animation

This is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript project that displays a glowing neon blue flower that grows and fades out in a loop. Perfect as a creative visual or decorative GitHub Pages splash.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- A `div` element is styled with radial gradients and glowing blue shadows.
- CSS animations are used to scale the "flower" in size and change its opacity to simulate growth and fade.
- JavaScript restarts the animation loop every 6 seconds.
